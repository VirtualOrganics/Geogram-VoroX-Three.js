# Geogram-VoroX-Three.js

[Live Demo](https://virtualorganics.github.io/Geogram-VoroX-Three.js/)

A WebAssembly-powered 3D periodic Delaunay-Voronoi triangulation library for the browser, combining the computational power of [Geogram](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram) with the visualization capabilities of [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). This variant adds a VoroX-inspired circumcenter-based Voronoi construction alongside the existing barycenter method.

## VoroX Dynamics Controls

The "Flow Dynamics" section provides detailed control over the simulation's physics and appearance. These controls are the "brain" of the program, allowing you to explore different dynamic behaviors based on the principles of the VoroX model.

### Core Physics Parameters

*   **Decay**: This slider controls the "friction" or energy dissipation in the system. A value of `1.0` means no friction, which allows energy to build up indefinitely and can lead to explosive instability. Lower values (e.g., `0.95`) act like a drag force, causing the accumulated flow energy to fade each frame. This is crucial for allowing the system to shed energy and settle into a stable, dynamic equilibrium.
*   **dt**: Represents the "delta time" or the size of the integration step for each frame of the simulation. Conceptually, it's how far into the future the simulation jumps in each step. Higher values lead to faster evolution but increase the risk of "overshooting" a stable state and becoming numerically unstable.
*   **Energy**: A global multiplier for the strength of all calculated forces. You can think of this as the "temperature" or "kinetic energy" of the system. Higher values produce more dramatic and rapid movement, while lower values result in a more gentle relaxation.
*   **Scale**: This is the target or "ideal" distance that the simulation tries to establish between connected points. This parameter is central to the concept of homothety in the VoroX model, where each tetrahedron attempts to expand or contract its edges to this ideal length, driving the self-organization of the entire structure.

### Force Model Toggles

These toggles control which components of the VoroX force model are active.

*   **Edge Scale**: When checked, forces are calculated between every pair of points within a tetrahedron (an edge-based model), akin to a spring network where every connection has a force. When unchecked, forces are calculated between each point and the tetrahedron's stable center (a center-based model). The edge-based model is more computationally intensive and typically results in a more energetic, "tense" equilibrium.
*   **Equilibration**: Toggles the main homothety force that pushes and pulls points to achieve the ideal `Scale` distance. This is the primary driver of organization in the simulation.
*   **Contractive**: Toggles a secondary, asymmetric force that gently pulls points together. Its strength is weighted by the "catchment" area of the flow knots, meaning it has a greater effect on points that are part of larger flow structures.
*   **Expansive**: Toggles a secondary, asymmetric force that gently pushes points apart, also weighted by the knot catchment area. Using `Contractive` and `Expansive` allows for fine-tuning the clustering or dispersion behavior of the system.

### Visualization Controls

*   **Max Segs**: A performance and visualization control. It limits the maximum number of flow edges drawn to the screen to prevent the display from becoming cluttered or slow.
*   **Flow**: Toggles the visibility of the VoroX flow edges.
*   **Knots**: Toggles the visibility of detected cycles (knots) in the flow. When active, knot edges are highlighted with thicker, black strokes.
*   **Ghost Cells**: In periodic mode, this toggles the visibility of the 26 neighboring "ghost" cells, helping to visualize the toroidal, wrapped nature of the space.
*   **Color by Knot**: When checked, flow edges belonging to a knot are colored with a unique hue for each distinct knot. When unchecked, all flow edges are colored by their accumulated energy (from blue for low energy to red for high energy), providing a visual representation of the energy distribution and dissipation in the system.

## Quick Start

### Using the Library

```javascript
import { DelaunayComputation } from './src/js/DelaunayComputation.js';

// Initialize the WASM module
const Module = await window.PeriodicDelaunayModule();

// Create points (array of [x, y, z] coordinates in range [0, 1])
const points = [
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
    // ... more points
];

// Create computation instance
// third parameter selects Voronoi construction method: 'barycenter' (default) or 'circumcenter'
const computation = new DelaunayComputation(points, true, 'circumcenter');

// Run the computation
await computation.compute(Module);

// Access results
console.log(`Computed ${computation.tetrahedra.length} tetrahedra`);
console.log(`Generated ${computation.voronoiEdges.length} Voronoi edges`);

// Tetrahedra: array of [v0, v1, v2, v3] vertex indices
// Voronoi edges: array of {start: [x,y,z], end: [x,y,z], isPeriodic: boolean}
```

### Visualization Example

```javascript
// Draw Delaunay edges
for (const tet of computation.tetrahedra) {
    // Extract and draw edges from tetrahedron
}

// Draw Voronoi diagram
for (const edge of computation.voronoiEdges) {
    const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
    const positions = new Float32Array([
        edge.start[0], edge.start[1], edge.start[2],
        edge.end[0], edge.end[1], edge.end[2]
    ]);
    geometry.setAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(positions, 3));
    
    const material = edge.isPeriodic ? 
        new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffaa00 }) : 
        new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff6600 });
    
    const line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);
    scene.add(line);
}
```

## API Reference

### DelaunayComputation Class

#### Constructor
```javascript

```

- `voronoiMethod`: `'barycenter' | 'circumcenter'` Voronoi construction

#### Methods
```javascript
async compute(wasmModule)
```
Runs the Delaunay-Voronoi computation. Returns the instance for chaining.

```javascript
getStats()
```
Returns an object with computation statistics:
```javascript
{
    numPoints: number,
    numTetrahedra: number,
    numVoronoiEdges: number,

- C++17 compiler

### Build Steps

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VirtualOrganics/Geogram-VoroX-Three.js.git
cd Geogram-VoroX-Three.js

# Build the WASM module
cd src/cpp
./build.sh

# The compiled files will be in dist/

## Implementation Details

### Voronoi Computation
Two methods are available:
1. Barycenter method (default): compute tetra centroids and connect centroids of adjacent tets.
2. Circumcenter method (VoroX-inspired): compute tetra circumcenters with a numerical safeguard (fallback to centroid on near-degeneracy), then connect circumcenters of adjacent tets. Periodic handling adjusts vertices to a consistent image prior to computing centers, then wraps back to the unit cube.

### Periodic Boundaries
When periodic mode is enabled:
- Points are assumed to be in the unit cube [0, 1]Â³
- The space wraps around at the boundaries (toroidal topology)
- Edges crossing boundaries are marked with `isPeriodic: true`

## Controls Guide

### Main Controls
- **Points**: The number of random points to generate.
- **Min Dist**: The minimum distance between generated points.
- **Motion**: The randomness of the point movement. Higher values result in more erratic paths.
- **Speed**: The speed at which the points travel.
- **Live Update**: When checked, the triangulation and Voronoi diagrams continuously update to reflect point motion.
- **Update Step**: Sets the number of frames to wait before each live update. Higher values are less intensive.
- **Periodic**: Toggles periodic boundary conditions, making the space wrap around like a torus.
- **Ghost Cells**: Displays the 26 neighboring "ghost" cells in periodic mode to visualize the toroidal space.
- **Background**: The background color of the scene.
- **Poisson**: Toggles Poisson disk sampling for point generation, which creates more evenly spaced points.
- **MIC**: Toggles the "Minimum Image Convention" visualization mode, which enables thick, adjustable edges.
- **Boundary**: Toggles the visibility of the boundary box.

### Delaunay Triangles / Tetrahedra
- **Vertices**: Toggles the visibility of the Delaunay vertices (the input points).
- **Delaunay**: Toggles the visibility of the Delaunay edges.
- **Tetrahedra**: Toggles the visibility of the Delaunay tetrahedra (the 3D cells).

### Voronoi Diagrams
- **Voronoi**: Toggles the visibility of the Voronoi edges.
- **Faces**: Toggles the visibility of the Voronoi cell faces.
- **Random Colors**: Toggles random coloring for the Voronoi faces.
