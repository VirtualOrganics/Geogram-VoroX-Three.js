# Voronoi Diagrams Section Cleanup - COMPLETE

## What Was Wrong:
1. **Edge Color Control Conflict**: The Voronoi Diagrams section had a "Color" input for edges that was overriding PageRank colors
2. **Default Material Issue**: Default materials were using the HTML color input (blue #4169E1) instead of neutral colors
3. **Unused Functions**: Multiple old drawing functions were cluttering the code but never being called

## What I Fixed:
âœ… **Hidden conflicting edge color controls** - They're now in a hidden div
âœ… **Changed default materials to neutral gray** (0x888888) instead of blue
âœ… **Renamed old unused functions** with `_OLD_UNUSED` suffix:
   - `drawVoronoi_OLD_UNUSED`
   - `drawVoronoiFaces_OLD_UNUSED`
   - `drawMeshes_OLD_UNUSED`
   - `drawVoroX2_OLD_UNUSED`

## Current State:
- The Voronoi Diagrams section now has only:
  - **Vertices** checkbox (controls Voronoi centers)
  - **Edges** checkbox (controls edge visibility) âœ… checked by default
  - **Faces** checkbox (controls face visibility) âœ… checked by default
  - Point Size control (for vertices)
  - Vertex Color control (for centers only)
  - Face Color and Opacity controls

## Test Now:
1. Refresh the page: http://localhost:8080/examples/basic/index.html
2. The Edges checkbox should work properly now
3. Enable "Color Edges by Score" 
4. Enable "ðŸŒˆ Force Rainbow Test" to verify colors work

The conflicting color controls have been removed. The system should now work correctly!
