# Code Cleanup Summary

## âœ… MAIN FIX COMPLETED

### The Problem:
- **`drawDelaunay()` was drawing Voronoi edges!** This was the root cause.
- These edges ignored the "Edges" checkbox and were always yellow
- They appeared whenever the Delaunay checkbox was enabled

### The Solution:
- Removed ALL Voronoi-related code from `drawDelaunay()`
- Now `drawDelaunay()` ONLY draws Delaunay edges (as it should)
- `drawVoronoiAndFlow()` is the ONLY function handling Voronoi content

## Functions to Remove (OLD_UNUSED)

These functions are marked as OLD_UNUSED and are not called anywhere:

1. **`drawVoronoi_OLD_UNUSED`** (lines ~865-914)
   - Old Voronoi edge drawing function
   - Replaced by `drawVoronoiAndFlow()`

2. **`drawVoronoiFaces_OLD_UNUSED`** (lines ~916-990)  
   - Old Voronoi face drawing function
   - Replaced by face drawing in `drawVoronoiAndFlow()`

3. **`drawMeshes_OLD_UNUSED`** (lines ~993-1166)
   - Old combined drawing function
   - Replaced by separate `drawDelaunay()` and `drawVoronoiAndFlow()`

4. **`drawVoroX2_OLD_UNUSED`** (lines ~1169-?)
   - Old VoroX flow drawing
   - Replaced by flow drawing in `drawVoronoiAndFlow()`

## Test the Fix

1. Refresh http://localhost:8080/examples/basic/index.html
2. The "Edges" checkbox in Voronoi Diagrams should now work properly
3. Edges will be colored by PageRank scores when "Color Edges by Score" is enabled

## Next Steps

The OLD_UNUSED functions can be safely removed to clean up the codebase.
They total approximately 400+ lines of dead code.
