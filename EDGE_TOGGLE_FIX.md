# Edge Toggle Fix - COMPLETE

## What Was Wrong:

1. **Early Return Bug**: The faces drawing code had `if (!showFaces) return;` which would exit the entire function early, preventing any code after it from running

2. **Improper If Block**: The faces code wasn't properly wrapped in an if block

## What I Fixed:

‚úÖ **Wrapped face drawing in proper if block**: Changed from:
```javascript
if (!showFaces) return;
// face drawing code...
```
To:
```javascript
if (showFaces) {
    // face drawing code...
}
```

‚úÖ **Added Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track:
- When drawVoronoiAndFlow is called
- Whether edges should be drawn
- Group visibility states

## How It Works Now:

1. When you toggle the "Edges" checkbox, it triggers `updateScene()`
2. `updateScene()` calls `drawVoronoiAndFlow(foam)`
3. `drawVoronoiAndFlow()`:
   - Clears all groups (removes old geometry)
   - Checks if edges should be shown
   - Only draws edges if checkbox is checked
   - Sets group visibility appropriately

## Test It:

1. Refresh the page
2. Open F12 Console
3. Toggle the Edges checkbox
4. You should see in console:
   - "üìç drawVoronoiAndFlow called"
   - "üéØ Edge Drawing Check: showVoronoiEdges = false" (when unchecked)
   - "üéØ Edge Drawing Check: showVoronoiEdges = true" (when checked)

The edges should now properly appear/disappear when you toggle the checkbox!
